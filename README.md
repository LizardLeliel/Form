Some files are excluded from the repository; namely testing files, sample input,
and "lex.yy.c", the file generated from "formLang.flex". If you wish to build this
program from a clone on your computer (Even though its nowhere near completition), 
type "sudo apt-get install flex" into the command bar, go the the clone's root directory,
and type "flex flexLang.flex". lex.yy.c will be generated, and will be able to link
